## Usage üìò

Once installed, you can start using the Runbook Operator to generate documentation. Here‚Äôs how:

1. **Create a PrometheusRule**:
   Define your alerting rules in a YAML file. For example:
   ```yaml
   apiVersion: monitoring.coreos.com/v1
   kind: PrometheusRule
   metadata:
     name: example-alert
   spec:
     groups:
       - name: example
         rules:
           - alert: HighErrorRate
             expr: job:request_errors:rate5m > 0.05
             for: 5m
             labels:
               severity: critical
             annotations:
               summary: "High error rate detected"
               description: "The error rate is above 5% for the last 5 minutes."
   ```

2. **Apply the PrometheusRule**:
   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f your-prometheus-rule.yaml
   ```

3. **Generate Runbook Documentation**:
   The Runbook Operator will automatically generate documentation based on the defined PrometheusRules. You can find the output in your specified format.

## Output Formats üóÇÔ∏è

The Runbook Operator supports multiple output formats, including:

- **Markdown**: Ideal for GitHub repositories.
- **HTML**: Great for internal documentation sites.
- **PDF**: For offline access and printing.
- **JSON**: Useful for integration with other tools.

You can specify the desired format in your configuration. For example:
